## PAPALYZERS – Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction Chatbot

PAPALYZERS is a machine learning–driven healthcare chatbot developed during BioHackathon 2025 to support early detection of cervical cancer.

The system leverages a stacking ensemble of multiple ML models trained on clinically relevant risk factors to predict outcomes for four cervical screening tests (Biopsy, Cytology, Schiller, Hinselmann). Model outputs are combined using a weighted probabilistic framework and mapped into intuitive risk zones (Low / Medium / High), enabling personalized screening recommendations.

This project demonstrates applied machine learning in healthcare, with a strong emphasis on recall optimization, class imbalance handling, and clinically meaningful decision support.
